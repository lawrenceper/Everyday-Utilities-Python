# Everyday-Utilities (Python)
Everyday Utilities (Python) are Python Scripts that can assist people with everyday tasks. For example, the calculater script can be used for basic calculations, such as 20 plus 37. These scripts should be accessible for the blind, as long as they use the command line or terminal window instead of runnning them directly in the Python GUI. These Python scripts have been tested on Windows and Ubuntu, but they might work with your operating system. Please use Python 2 instead of Python 3. 
##Running the scripts
Please install Python 2 before continuing. Ubuntu already has Python installed, but on Windows you will need to download and install it.
To run the scripts in a terminal, type "python" then the script you want to open. For example, to run the timer.py script, type "python timer.py". some terminal windows allow to press the tab key to autocomplete a file name
, which can be helpful to those who are using screen readers.
