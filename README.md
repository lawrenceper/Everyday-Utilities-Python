# Utilities-Terminal-Application-Bundle
These are bundled ZIP packages that contain programs that most people would either half to pay for, like calculator software and other useful items. These are so called Terminal Applications because they are ment to be run in a terminal window or Python shell. Because of this, I can support people with disabilities without having to go through all of the hard work that is required when writing programs with a graphical user interface (GUI). If a blind person uses the command line or Linux terminal to open these scripts in Python, then they can easily follow the prompts on screen. Almost every screen reader that has the ability to work with the command line or Linux terminal should work. Note:  not all screen readers have been tested yet. Results may vary from screen reader to screen reader.  I’m currently working on a timer and stopwatch. Other calculators and conversion calculators are planned for the future.
Make sure that you have an active price on installation on your computer. All these programs were written in Python programming language.
