# Utilities-Terminal-Application-Bundle

This is a bundle  of Python scripts. It contains programs
like calculator software and other
 items. Games are also included. These are so called Terminal Applications because they
are meant to be run in a terminal window or Python shell. Because of
this, these scripts/programs support people with screen readers without having to go
through all of the hard work that is required when writing programs
with a graphical user interface (GUI). If a blind person uses the
command line or Linux terminal to open these scripts in Python, then
they can easily follow the prompts on screen. Almost every screen
reader that has the ability to work with the command line or Linux
terminal should work. Note: not all screen readers have been tested
yet. Results may vary from screen reader to screen reader.  I’m
currently working on a timer, a stopwatch and a basic simple
calculator. Other calculators and conversion calculators are planned
for the future.

##How to Run These Applications

Make sure that you have an active Python installation on your
computer. All these programs were written in the Python programming
language. You will need to install the latest Python 2.7X version on
your computer. It is also possible to run all of these scripts in
iOS. You'll need to download an app with Python 2.7X or later. Then
you will need to make sure that the app can open Python files from other
apps. It is possible to store this repository onto your own personal
Dropbox folder, so you can import them into your python app
easily. Some apps might support ZIP files, in which case all you would
need to do to open all the files at once is to open the zip package
and unzip it with commands on the app. Please note: I wrote these
files on a Windows 8.1 laptop. I don't know for sure if your other
operating system will work with these programs, but I tried to
eliminate all the modules that require a certain operating system.

##Contributing

In order to contribute, please fork your own copy of this
repository. This way, your changes will not affect this repository. To
contribute your own code, you can, after you fork this repository and
make your changes, send me a message on GitHub with the link of your
repository, so I can test out your code, and send you a pull request
if the code has no issues with it. Also, please provide a detailed
explanation of what you've changed.

##Translators

I don't know any other languages other than English and Spanish, and
I don't know any other programming languages other than Python
2.7X. Please help by translating into your native languages, and also
to other programming languages. Please remember to fork this
repository so your changes don't affect this repository!

##Reporting Issues/Bugs

You can use the GitHub website to do this. Notes to myself: To be
written, unsure of how to do this yet.
